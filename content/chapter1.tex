\begin{theorem}
    $\mathbb{C}$, the complex numbers, is complete.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    For a Cauchy sequence of complex numbers $\{z_n\}$, then
    \[
        |z_n-z_m|\to 0 \quad\text{as}\quad n,m\to\infty.
    \]
    In other words, given $\epsilon>0$ there exists an
    integer $N>0$ so that $|z_n-z_m|<\epsilon$ whenever $n,m>N$.
    If assuming $z_n=x_n+iy_n, z_m=x_m+iy_m$, so we can get
    \[
        |z_n-z_m|=\sqrt{(x_n-x_m)^2+(y_n-y_m)^2}.
    \]
    According to Cauchy's convergence theorem: every Cauchy sequence
    of real numbers converges to a real number. So we can get the Cauchy's
    convergence theorem of complex numbers.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    The set $\Omega\subset \mathbb{C}$ is compact if and only if every sequence
    $\{z_n\}\subset \Omega$ has a subsequence that converges to a point in $\Omega$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	For a compact set $\Omega$, then it is closed and bounded.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    A set $\Omega$ is compact if and only if every open covering of
    $\Omega$ has a finite subcovering.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Continuous functions}

\begin{theorem}
    A continuous function on a compact set $\Omega$ is bounded and attains
    a maximum and minimum on $\Omega$.
